# Gwinnett Sports Equipment Collection

Welcome to our website! We're happy that you choose to help look into what we are doing and how you can help.

### What are we trying to accomplish?

For many families, sports is essential part of life, and plays an integral in developing character and discpline in children, as well keeping them active and enetrtained! However, many children grow at an extremly fast pace, and thus grow out of their sporting equipment well before it is worn out. For many us, myself included, this equipment simply goes into our closet, taking up space, never to be seen agin. Our goal is to collect this equipment and donate it to the local, park based athletic associations in our community, so that growth constraints never affect the ability of a child to pursue the sport of thier choice.

### Want to help?

If you want to contribute to the cause, please contact Andy Borst at 678-343-0540, or at andy.d.r.borst@gmail.com. I'd be happy to provide more deatils, answer questions, and help you become a part of our mission!
